complex event processing (short CEP)

what is it?

-	a rather new method of analyzing data (information) from one or multiple sources which comes in form of events
-	a process of continuous control
-	real-time process (information has to pass and is being processed)
-	is an upcoming and standardized method of analyzing data in industriell projects


where is it being used?

-	trading and logistics (Business Activity Monitoring)
-	network security
-	banking

known CEP user:
Oracle, IBM und Microsoft (are beginning to implement CEP Systems)


what is an event?

-	can be a change from one state into another state
	e.g. temparatur threshold is being passed: temparatur is normal (state 1) -> temparatur is too hot (state 2)
- 	can be a phone call or a post in a forum
-	a return code in a program	
-	a price change on a market

how does CEP work?

-	analyzes all incoming events
-	extracts information
-	puts them in relation to each other and decides on a complex event



what is a complex event?

-	a defined state which is triggered when certain events occur
-	can be a threat or opportunity

	e.g. football game in hannover:
		-	severall events in form of bomb threats were registered
		-	many people in one place
	->	complex event: danger for the people

how does CEP work 2 ?
in detail:
-	compared to traditional databases CEP uses different and newer algorithms
-	everything is being processed using only the main memory of the machine which analyzes
	(no database are used to store data)
-	a CEP-system is being fed with tasks (example: search query by a User using GOOGLE)
	-	the results of this task are transmitted to adapters which return them to where the task was sent
	
example tasks:
-	give a warning when body temperature is above 39°C (smarwatch)
-	return every minute the amount of visitors on a website
-	warn the user when he has lost his gps signal (smartphone)
-	send an email when price of an article drops (amazon/ebay/geizhals)



advantages of CEP compared to Databasesystems?

-	CEP-system are fast and scalable (e.g. severall servers)
-	on system can process severall thousands of events every second

-	to analyze timecritical information in real-time 
-	allows reacting to possible threats, crashes or opportunities as fast as possible
		-	proactive (meaning: to react to sth. before it happens)
-	identifying complex events as fast as possible as well as more reliable
-	prevent events from occuring (nip in the bud(im Keim ersticken))

conclusion:

CEP is a collection of technics, tools and methods to analyze and process data in realtime
-	is a Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) as well as	 Event-Driven Architecture (EDA)
