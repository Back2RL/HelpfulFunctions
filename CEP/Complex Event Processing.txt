complex event processing (short CEP)

what is it?

-	a method of analyzing data (information) from one or multiple sources which comes in form of an event
-	is applied close to real-time

what is an event?

-	can be a change from one state into another state
	e.g. temparatur threshold is being passed: temparatur is normal (state 1) -> temparatur is too hot (state 2)
- 	can be a phone call or a post in a forum
-	a return code in a program	

how does CEP work?

-	analyzes all incoming events and puts them in relation to each other and decides on a complex event



what is a complex event?

-	a defined state which is triggered when certain events occur
-	can be a threat or opportunity

	e.g. football game in hannover:
		-	severall events in form of bomb threats were registered
		-	many people in one place
	->	complex event: danger and possible casualties



goals?

-	allows to react to possible threats, crashes or opportunities before they can manifest
-	identifying complex events as fast as possible as well as more reliable
-	prevent events from occuring (nip in the bud(im Keim ersticken))
