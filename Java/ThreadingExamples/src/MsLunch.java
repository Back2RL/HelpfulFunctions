//Synchronized statements are also useful for improving concurrency with fine-grained synchronization.
//Suppose, for example, class MsLunch has two instance fields, c1 and c2, that are never used together. 
//All updates of these fields must be synchronized, but there's no reason to prevent an update of c1 from
//being interleaved with an update of c2 â€” and doing so reduces concurrency by creating unnecessary blocking.
//Instead of using synchronized methods or otherwise using the lock associated with this, we create two objects solely to provide locks.
public class MsLunch {
	@SuppressWarnings("unused")
	private long c1 = 0;
	@SuppressWarnings("unused")
	private long c2 = 0;
	private Object lock1 = new Object();
	private Object lock2 = new Object();

	public void inc1() {
		synchronized (lock1) {
			c1++;
		}
	}

	public void inc2() {
		synchronized (lock2) {
			c2++;
		}
	}
}

// Use this idiom with extreme care. You must be absolutely sure that it really
// is safe to interleave access of the affected fields.
